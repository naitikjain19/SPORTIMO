INGENIOUS HACKATHON

TAGLINE: PLAY FAIR WITH SPORTIMO

TEAM ALPHA



Hi, we are team Alpha from Mumbai.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

All athletes have their own identification e.g. Aadhar Card, Birth Certificate etc. The cheats among them conceal the certificates when they come to know that the age entered in their original documents make them ineligible to participate in junior competitions. Instead, with the connivance of unscrupulous touts, they “manufacture “fake documents which make them eligible to participate in the relevant competition. They upload these fake documents on web-portals. It should be made binding on the part of sports bodies to accept genuine documents (via web authentication) produced by athletes as proof of age.



Technical: -(FLOW)

➢	So, this is our home page of our website which shows all Upcoming sports events and the navigation bar has following buttons such as Home, explore, profile, contact, login, logout.

➢	Basically, if the user wants to access the upcoming events then he/she must be logged in compulsorily.

➢	So, now you have two options to login/register into the website via google account or via your email id and password.

➢	Now the user has to choose between whether he is an organiser or a participant because only organiser has an access to organize an event.

➢	After the user has logged in, a page for users’ details will be popped up in which you have to mention all your details and you have to upload your Aadhar card for verification.

➢	(Points updated):

1)National Level-300 Points

2)State Level-200 Points

3)District Level-100 Points

 

➢	Now the Aadhar card verification is required because sport events may have lot of age fraud and forgery id

➢	So, the Aadhar card will be verified by reading text using the concept of OCR i.e. Optical character recognition which is basically a ML concept and thus comparing the extracted text from the database which has Aadhar details of all the citizens.

User: Organizer:
➢	Since, the user is an organizer he/she will get an access to create an event.

➢	Now, after the event; organizer will update the winner’s list.

User: participant:

➢	After verification, the user can access all the events. By clicking on one of the events, the user will get all the details of that event.

➢	Now clicking on apply now, the user will be asked to join or create a team.

➢	If you are creating the team for the event, then you have to mention your team name and after that, the user will get a unique code and using that code in join team section, your team members can join the team respectively.

➢	The team will be selected if your team size is appropriate with the team size mentioned in that event.

➢	After the event has ended, the winners list will be updated and according to the rank, the total points of the user will be updated.

➢	The points will be calculated by the following formula:

First Prize/ (team rank*No of teams)

Future Work:
➢	The organizer will charge some amount for organizing an event.

➢	Increase Scalability and Monitoring

The Problems it Solves:

➢	Prevent users with fake Aadhar Card because sports events may have lot of age fraud and forgery id.

➢	This website is providing a platform for the deserving athletes to showcase their skills also it is motivating to participate in more events

Conclusion:

Thus, this is a genuine attempt to develop a fully responsive sports events website for all the enthusiastic sportsperson with real citizen identity.
